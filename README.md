# Prototype world

3d demo type game made with Godot. Mostly focused on 3d terrain generation.

The terrain generation is done with opensimplex noise & a random seed. Threading is used  on pc to speed up the generation. I had some mesh related issues with threading on android, so it's disabled there & as a result the generation takes much longer.

## Contains:
* 3d environment, procedurally generated on the fly 
* Simple enemies
* Resources
* Items
